##  Day 8 Task Report: VPN Setup and Privacy Evaluation
## Objective
To understand the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in protecting user privacy and enabling secure communication. This task involved hands-on VPN setup, connection testing, and evaluation of its encryption and privacy features.

#Tools used
--Operating System: Kali Linux

--VPN Client: ProtonVPN CLI

--IP Check Website: whatismyipaddress.com

--Browser Used: Firefox

##Steps Performed
 1. Account Creation
An account was created on a reputable VPN provider to access their secure VPN services.

2. VPN Client Installation
ProtonVPN CLI was installed on Kali Linux using the following commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y protonvpn-cli

 3. Login to VPN
Logged in to the VPN client via terminal:
protonvpn-cli login [username]

 4. VPN Connection
A secure VPN connection was established using Smart Connect:
protonvpn-cli connect --sc

This connected to the nearest available VPN server for optimal performance.

 5. IP Address Verification
After connection, the IP address was verified using:
firefox https://whatismyipaddress.com

A new IP address was observed, confirming the VPN was successfully masking the real IP.
Screenshot of IP address after VPN connection attached.

 6. Traffic Encryption Test
A secure HTTPS website (https://www.wikipedia.org) was accessed. The connection was successful, indicating that all web traffic was being encrypted.

7. Disconnection and Comparison
The VPN was disconnected using:
protonvpn-cli disconnect

The IP was checked again to confirm it returned to the original. Basic browsing speed was also tested before and after the VPN connection.

##  VPN Encryption & Privacy Features
--Encryption Protocols: The VPN uses strong encryption such as AES-256 with protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard.

--Privacy: Ensures that the user's IP address and data traffic are hidden from ISPs and third parties.

--DNS Leak Protection: Ensures no DNS queries are leaked outside the VPN tunnel.

--Kill Switch: Automatically stops traffic if VPN disconnects unexpectedly (available in GUI versions).

##  Benefits of Using a VPN
--Hides real IP address, masking user location.

--Encrypts internet traffic, even on public Wi-Fi.

--Prevents tracking by ISPs and websites.

--Bypasses geographic restrictions and censorship.

## Limitations
--May slightly reduce internet speed due to encryption overhead.

--Some websites may block access when VPN is detected.

--A VPN does not protect from malware or phishing â€” additional tools are needed for that.

## Conclusion
This task provided practical experience in configuring and testing a VPN on a Linux system. It demonstrated how VPNs protect user privacy, encrypt communication, and allow anonymous browsing. Understanding VPNs is essential for cybersecurity professionals, especially when operating in high-risk or surveillance-heavy environments.
